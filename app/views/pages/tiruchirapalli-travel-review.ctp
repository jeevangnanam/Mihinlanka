The Dubai climate is an arid subtropical climate due to Dubai being located within the Northern desert belt. The skies over Dubai are generally completely blue with little cloud cover. Due to the Dubai weather and its blue skies, Dubai has become a popular destination for astronomers. The weather in Dubai can bring short and irregular rainfall as is typical for the Middle East. Most of the rainfall in Dubai occurs between December and March. The period between December and March is when the Dubai weather conditions are considered to be the best as the temperature cools down to a more comfortable level. The period between December and March each year is considered by the Dubai hotel and travel industry to be the tourism high season of Dubai. The weather in Dubai during the tourist high season is pleasant with average temperatures of around 24 degrees Celsius during daytime.
