            <td align="left" valign="top" style='font-size:12px;padding-left:10px;'><p><strong class="BoldAndBlue">Colombo</strong> - the trade and commercial capital has long been the traditional gateway to the Orient.  Sri Lanka's largest city, it is located on the west coast and draws together all the cultures, religions and influences of foreign lands into a pot-pourri of sounds, smells and a kaleidoscope of colour. The original traders and settlers - the Arabs, Portuguese, Dutch and the British have left in their wake churches and monuments, names and religions, costumes and food and smatterings of their languages which have been absorbed into the speech of the Sri Lankan. Today, Colombo is a fascinating city - a happy blend of east &amp; west, past &amp; present, with a charm of its own. </p>
              <p>A less known but amazingly true fact is that Colombo has a superb range of high quality restaurants serving food from all over the world and some of the best shopping opportunities in Asia. The main seaport of Sri Lanka is in Colombo &amp; adjoining it, is Pettah, a local bazaar &amp; trading area.  Other places of interest are the beautiful Buddhist temples, Hindu temples, mosques, the  historic Wolfendhal church, (1749) residential areas where you find the stately  homes of the affluent, the Colombo Museum, the Bandaranaike Memorial  International Conference Hall, the Folk Art Centre, Art Galleries, Parks,  Independence Square, the Zoo, the Ceramic Corporation famous for its well known  brand &ldquo;Noritake&rdquo; and ODEL the renowned shopping centre. 
              </p>
              <p><strong class="BoldAndBlue">Shopping in the City</strong> - Colombo's primary bazaar  district is Pettah, located next to the Fort District. The narrow cobble-stone  streets are lined with stalls and shops that sell a vast array of fabrics,  clothing, handbags, jewelry, watches, electronics, shoes, books, household  items, and much more, at really great prices. Another good shopping area if  you're looking for crafts is the Laksala Emporium. Run by the government, the  goods here are top-notch. Selections range from painted wooden masks and  lacquer ware to batik and handloom cloth. For other high-quality items, check  the Handloom Emporium, the Sri Lanka Gem &amp; Jewelry Exchange, and the shops  around the Cinnamon Gardens.</p>
              <p> Larger scale shopping is available, too, at Crescat Boulevard  and Majestic City, both on Galle Road, ODEL &amp; Beverley Street,  and House of Fashion. These larger malls feature clothing stores, restaurants,  supermarkets, and cinemas. Many shoppers in Sri   Lanka have their eye out for the famous Ceylon tea. One  safe bet is Tea Tang, with locations at Liberty  Plaza, Galle Face Court, the World Trade   Center, and the airport.  Another good option is Mlesna Tea, with shops at Liberty  Plaza, Majestic City,  the Hilton, Crescat Boulevard,  and the airport not forgetting Dilmah Tea</p></td>
